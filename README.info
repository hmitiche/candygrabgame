This is a quick tutorial for Candy Grab game which is coded in Python. 
I augumented the code to facilitate tests and 
added the possiblity to play machine vs. human

* candygrab.py: The game environment
• agent.py: The Agent base class. All agents inherit from this simple base class.
• agent*.py: Implementations of various agents. We saw some of these in lecture.
• play_round.py: script to have two agents (the 2nd maybe a human) play one round of the game
• play_many_rounds.py: script to have two agents play many rounds of the game 
(one can be a human), stats are printed at the end.

Python2.10 at least is required

To run the game, simple open Terminal, 
and type (Linux/MacOS):

python play_round.py

you may rather type:

python3.11 play_round.py 

as I do, if you default python is older then v2.10
